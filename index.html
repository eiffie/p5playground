<body style="font-family:Verdana"><h2>Eiffie's p5 Playground</h2><br>
This is a place to play with interactive p5 code examples.
p5 is processing for javascript which is a widely used
graphics package that can run online or off.
Each page is a single html file that only references p5.min.js
for easy downloading and editing. Grab a copy of 
<a href="p5.min.js">p5.min.js here</a> by right clicking
and selecting 'save link as'. Similarly each example can be downloaded
for offline use or you can grab the whole website from 
<a href="github.com/eiffie/p5playground">github.</a> Along with learning p5 coding
the html files will show some easy ways to setup editable code
with javascript. I will be learning along with you and only
promise to make the examples unique and hopefully interesting.
NOTE: These examples all run without a server. If you need to
load assets from a file p5 requires a server.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="shelves.html">Warped Shelves:</a> Getting started with
a static image created in the setup function.
</li>
<li>
<a href="stringbox.html">String Box:</a> Let's get things moving
with the draw function.
</li>
<li>
<a href="orbits.html">Orbits:</a> Some things need both setup and 
draw. Let's try 2 textareas to track the motion of a satellite around
a moon, around a planet, around a star.
</li>
<li>
<a href="dct.html">DCT codec:</a> Images can be loaded in p5 but that's
too easy. Lets try unpacking a heavily compressed image with the help
of a discrete cosine transform.
</li>
<li>
<a href="daisies.html">Euler Daisies:</a> You may have heard of Euler
Spirals but we will add a slider to create a selectable # of petals.
</li>
<li>
<a href="iijtiles.html">(i*i)%j Tiles:</a> The unpredictability of the
Euler Daisies boils down to the interesting behavior of (i*i)%j.
</li>
<li>
<a href="shader.html">Shader Example:</a> Let's edit some glsl and run it
with p5's easy to use functions.
</li>
<li>
<a href="iijmusic.html">Sound Example:</a> p5.sound doesn't work offline
so we bypass it and go straight to WebAudio. Turns out its easier too!
</li>
<li>
<a href="bouncy.html">Bouncy the Game:</a> Let's put everything we've learned
into a playable game demo.

</ul>
