So far we have only implemented 1 function. Now we will do both setup and draw.
At this point we need to go over the 2 different ways p5 is instantiated.
Normally you create script tags for p5.min.js and your code containing setup and
draw functions. p5 automatically loads those functions from the window object. 
This is called a global instance. There can only be 1 global instance per browser
frame. The other method when the code isn't available at page load or you need
multiple instances per web page or you need exact placement on the page
is to wrap the preload, setup and draw functions
in a sketch closure and call the p5 constructor with it and the html element
that will contain the canvas. If you look at the source for this page at
the top you see a function call runp5. It isn't long but it does alot. First
we remove any running instances of p5. Then create a sketch closure which is
a function that sets the preload, setup and draw functions. We set the setup
and draw function to evaluate the textarea using javascript's eval() and html's
textarea.value property. This makes it easier to use 2 textareas 1 for each
function. Otherwise you could parse the textarea code into 2 functions but that
may be misleading since there is no room for global variables 
(vars defined outside of functions) when using a sketch closure. Instead we
will pass variables between our setup and draw function using function properties.
To create a function property you just use it. For example setup.a=[1,2,3]
creates an array  in the function setup that can be used in draw as setup.a[0].

But this example is much simpler. What does it look like when you trace the
path of objects in space orbiting stars, planets and moons. Well not like this
but the idea is the same. Things get complex very quickly. Try different values
for scl. The radius shrinks and the angle speeds up at each iteration.
When you think you have it figured out which values give stable orbits and which
are unstable try .358256 or .390381! Now THAT is order from chaos.
