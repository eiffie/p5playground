Behind the magic of Euler Spirals is an even simpler formula (i*i)%j.
Remember the formula for the angle was i*(i+1)*c/2 and that (i+1) could
be changed (i+1/p) to produce petals. What if p was infinite? We get (i*i)*C
where C=c/2. But then we use the angle in trig functions which take the
modulus of the angle by 2*PI. What if we simply take (i*i)%j where j is
some constant? Its easy to see the value i*i increases exponentially until
it hits j but then what? Would you believe it reverses its steps making a
perfect reflection. We will put our good fortune to use with (i*i)%j tiles.

So far our animations have run as fast as possible. This one
we slow down by calling frameRate(1) in the small setup script in the html
document. View the documents source and look at the top for the runp5() function.

Try other values for j besides 51. What are the differences between even
and odd values? Prime and not prime? Have you noticed you can edit on the
fly and see changes instantly since the draw function is defined as
eval(txtDraw.value). This isn't such a good idea. It would be better
to call noLoop() when keypresses are made. noLoop() stops the draw
function from being called after the next execution.
