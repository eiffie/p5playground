<b>Eiffie Space</b> a testbed for web coding.<br>
<p>Here I will be testing out the functionality of webgl, WebAudio and various
related doodads. In the process I will create some games and puzzles to pass
the time enjoyably. Let's get started.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="singles/rollingDice.html">Rolling Dice</a> is a puzzle where you mark
    squares in a table by rolling an inked die. The goal is to mark every row 
    and column with unique numbers. We'll learn how to handle events and draw
    on a canvas.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/bouncy.html">Bouncy</a> is a down-scrolling game where you pilot
    a space-craft with 2 thrusters. I'll use webgl and WebAudio capabilities
    and utilize distance estimates, verlet physics and byte-beats!
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/stitchedStars.html">Stitched Stars</a> is an example of webgl frame
    buffers. 2 off-screen buffers flip positions as texture/buffer to draw pretty
    patterns.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/musicGenerator.html">Music Generator</a> creates a musical
    score based on the Sloth Canon using unicode fonts to draw the score.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/coinGames.html">Coins</a> is a 'simple' puzzle where you match
    patterns by sliding coins. Now part of Coin Games (first square)
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/pinball.html">Pinball</a> a fast ray-marched pinball game using
    distance estimates for collision and surface normals with simple physics.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/dct.html">DCT</a> Using a discrete Cosine Transform to compress/
    decompress an image.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/paintball.html">Paintball</a> batting a ball that you only see from
    it's fluid dynamics.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/pyramid.html">Hanoi's Pyramid</a> needs to be moved to higher ground
    before the river rises.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/textEditor.html">Text Editor</a> Let's make some utilities and learn
    about handling files on the client. Files are always saved in the download directory
    specified by the browser. I've added a read aloud button. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/base64.html">Base64 Enc/Dec</a> Storing files in code requires some
    encoding. Base64 offers a bit of compression over decimal encoding. This encoder/decoder
    will encode files and stringify the result to paste in javascript. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/iconEdit.html">Icon Editor</a> We need a slick favicon but most icon
    editors are point and click. This one is coded.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/iijTiles.html">(i*i*n)%j</a> We'll revisit utilities later. Time for
    some generative pattern fun. You would expect a formula with i*i in it to increase
    exponentially as i increases but tack on %j and its a crazy world of repeating/reflective
    patterns used here of drawing tiling and creating music. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/musicCD.html">Music Library</a> We've created alot of music to listen to
    in the browser but what if you want to download it. Say no more! 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/shaderEdit.html">Shader Editor</a> Some of those music shaders didn't
    work on my cheap phone. I want to edit them in the browser to see what fails. Here is
    a simple shader editor. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/chesstris.html">Chesstris</a> Like the name implies its a little bit
    Chess and a little bit Tetris but mostly just frustrating. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/solitare.html">Solitare</a> Not Solitare. We couldn't afford the licensing fee. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/evalPlaypen.html">Eval Playpen</a> When console isn't available it only takes
    a bit of code to implement the most useful feature, log. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/sensors.html">Sensors</a> Location, location, location. It's always good to
    know where you stand.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/mazeRunner.html">Maze Runner</a> Code an AI to navigate a maze.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/coinGames.html">7 Up</a> Let's use our base64 utility to add images to a coin
    flipping game. Now part of Coin Games.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/MIDIVisualizer.html">MIDI Visualizer</a> Connect a MIDI instrument and let's play!
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/coinGames.html">MatriX</a> A matrix puzzle. Now part of Coin Games.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/angryBee.html">Angry Bee</a> A 3d sound spacialization example with a
    vector class, webgl and WebAudio utility functions.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/fontTable.html">Font Table</a> See all the unicode glyphs/codes and
    load fonts for inspection.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/coinGames.html">Coin Games</a> As long as there are pennies there will
  be Coin Games. Check back for updated games.
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/babyIDE.html">Baby IDE</a> This should have been the first project! Let's
  create an IDE. The last 10% of a project takes 90% of the work so let's leave it out. 
  </li>
  <li><a href="singles/recorder.html">Dub Recorder</a> Multitrack audio recording the easy way. Dub dub dub!
  </li>
</ul>
